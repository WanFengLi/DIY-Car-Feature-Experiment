# DIY-Car-Feature-Experiment

This is a DIY mobile robot, with the majority of its components crafted through 3D printing. The chassis moves on flat surfaces using two drive wheels and one omnidirectional wheel. It is controlled by a Raspberry Pi and equipped with a camera capable of detecting specific objects or shapes.
